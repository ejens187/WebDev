    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h4>Evan Jensen | Section 001 | June 14, 2025</h4>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="justify">
        My name is Evan Jensen and I am a 22 year-old BYU student from Idaho Falls, ID. I am majoring in Statistics
        and am hoping to enter the Strategy Minor in the Marriott School of Business. I like taking long walks on
        the beach and am a very chill guy. My favorite Michael Scott quote is "I love inside jokes, I'd love to be 
        a part of one someday." Although I love the Office, my favorite TV show is actually Psych. My favorite Shawn 
        Spencer quote is "First of all, Gus, we haven't learned anything over the years."

    <p>I love working hard, but I also love playing hard. I feel like the two can't exist unless they coexist.</p>
    <p>Short Bucket List:
        <ol>
            <li>Go to Italy
                <ul>
                    <li>I want to try their gelato.</li>
                    <li>Venice, Rome, and Florence are a must.</li>
                    <li>Seeing the Alps would be cool too.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Go to Business School
                <ul>
                    <li>I gotta make the dough somehow, am I right?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Start a Business
                <ul>
                    <li>Probably in this order since Business School would help me start a business.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
